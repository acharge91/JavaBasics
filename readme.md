# First Java Project

**App.java**
- A simple Java programme with a method *greeting* that returns a greeting message based on the time of day stored in the *timeOfDay* variable.

**AppTest.java**
- A test file to ensure we get the correct greetings for various times of the day.

---

**BubbleSort.java**
- A Java programme that implements the bubble sorting algorithm. The method *getBubbleSortOfArray* iterates through an array of integers twice. Each iteration compares two adjacent integers, swapping them if the second is smaller than the first.

**BubbleSortTest.java**
- A test file that checks correct outputs for different array instances, such as negative integers.
