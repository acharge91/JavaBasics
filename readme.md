# Java Basics

**App.java**
- A simple Java programme with a method *greeting* that returns a greeting message based on the time of day stored in the *timeOfDay* variable.

**AppTest.java**
- A test file to ensure we get the correct greetings for various times of the day.

**BubbleSort.java**
- A Java programme that implements the bubble sorting algorithm. The method *getBubbleSortOfArray* iterates through an array of integers twice. Each iteration compares two adjacent integers, swapping them if the second is smaller than the first.

**BubbleSortTest.java**
- A test file that checks correct outputs for different array instances, such as negative integers. 

---

**MergeArrays.java**
- A java programme that contains a method *getMergedArray* which takes 2 sorted integer arrays and returns one sorted array containing all elements of both arrays. The method compares the values at a given index of both arrays and adds the lesser of the two into the merged array. Finally, it adds whatever remains from either array.

**MergeArraysTest.java**
- A test file that checks correct outputs for various array inputs including arrays with negative integers. It also tests for null inputs.
